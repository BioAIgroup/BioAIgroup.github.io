# BioAI Research Group Website

This is the website of the BioAI Research Group at the University of Glasgow.

It was derived with appreciation from the [Allan Lab Website](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab).

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).
