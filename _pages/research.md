# Research

Our overarching goal is to use computational biology approaches to gain a better understanding of biological systems. One focus is to develop deep neural network architectures to analyse high-throughput cancer data and push forward the area of precision medicine. We are interested in integrative approaches that combine high-throughput data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) on particular systems with existing biological knowledge from knowledge-bases such as biological network data (KEGG, Reactome). We are also investigating the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) to facilitate flexible and goal-driven analysis to integrate bioinformatics data and methods.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:
