# Open Positions


We are always looking for enthusiastic PhD students to join the group. <br />
Please send me an [email](mailto:kevin.bryson@glasgow.ac.uk) stating briefly why you are interested in joining the group and attach a CV.

Unfortunately we do not currently have any paid research positions available in the group.
